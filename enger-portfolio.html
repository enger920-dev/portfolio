    <h1>Gus Enger</h1>
    <p>
      I always struggle to find a place to start writing (and often even a time
      to start writing) though that's what I tell people that I "do" when it's
      time for small talk. What I actually "do" most often is talk, though folks
      seem to bear the prejudice that "talker" isn't a career. My septuagenarian
      mother always reminds me that one time I told her that I wanted my career
      to be "explaining shit," so she calls me her personal "shit explainer." If
      I would have known that she would repeat this to strangers so often, I
      probably would have said that I wanted to be a "concepts communicator," or
      something more clever and professional-sounding. Generally, I have always
      found great joy in the act of translation, which (if memory serves) bears
      its roots in the moving of things from one place to another. I think of my
      stuff-explaining as this sense of the word: I want to bring ideas to
      people and people to ideas. I used to joke that with a background in labor
      organizing and an academic background in media and now rhetoric, that I
      was working on my PhD in agitprop, but I don't think I need to give "them"
      any more reasons to put me on federal watchlists. It's a scary time to be
      alive, and not only because I'm super way far out of my comfort zone as an
      old dog learning new tricks with this course. It's fun and exciting and
      still feels like a magic trick. This isn't really a bio, but like I said,
      I just like to talk.
      <!-- I'm looking forward to getting more comfortable with styling text, and while I know it's not the goal of this exercise, I hate how blobs of words look!-->

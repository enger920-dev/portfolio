The Lego person has their hair in a bun, half-framed glasses, a patterned sweater with cats on it, and looks dismayed about being covered in cat hair and scratches. A white Lego cat looks up at them expectantly, as they are also holding a ball of yarn."
    /><!--I don't really have a "professional" photo of myself for these sorts of things. 
    I have an aversion to having my picture taken, as I said in the alt text, and this is 
    the image I use on Canvas, office signage, etc, to present a consistent persona for my students.
    Before I would publish this as an actual "business card website" kind of thing, I would probably get
    some professional photos taken, and just white knuckle my discomfort! -->

    <h2>Bio</h2>
    <p>
      Gus Enger is a PhD student in the Rhetoric and Professional Communication
      program at New Mexico State University, with a graduate minor in Gender
      and Sexuality Studies. They are the Chief Steward of United Electrical
      Local 1498, which represents the graduate workers at their university.
      Their research interests include critique of ideology, rhetorical media
      analysis, and critical pedagogy. They are happily married to a librarian,
      and together they care for three (very silly) cats.

      Web Writing Sample 1: <a href="diogenes.html">Diogenes of Sinope</a>
    </h3>
    <p>
      I was tasked with creating and styling a web page for a historical or
      fictional character, and I couldn't shake the idea that I should create
      something for a historical figure that would have absolutely hated the
      prospect of a personalized website. I chose to create this for Diogenes of
      Sinope (whose Wikipedia page is linked in the sample), the ancient Greek
      who is largely credited with originating philosohpical cynicism.
    </p>
    <p>
      I've had this 19th century painting by John William Waterhouse of him
      saved among my "inspiration" pieces for some time now, and I wanted to use
      it as my color palette for the page. Specifically, the page background is
      picked from the staircase (thematically, the setting), his job title from
      the sky (ironically, he prioritized humility), the text from the shadows
      (pragmatically, for high contrast), and the links from one of the women's
      toga (symbolically, he wants them to go away and links take you away).

    <p>
      The font style was taken from perusing websafe, handwritten fonts, and is
      "Permanent Marker".

      Web Writing Sample 2:
      <a href="https://enger920-dev.github.io/moestavern/">Moe's Tavern</a>
    </h3>
    <p>
      For this project, two of my fellow graduate students, Vicky Banuelos and
      Nafisa Mohammed, and I worked on creating a busienss website for a
      fictional business: Moe's Tavern from the probably-too-long-running show
      <i>The Simpsons</i>. We collaborated on the design and content of the
      site, but my focus was on creating an early-aughts style, multimedia
      "Easter Egg" for the <br />
      <span
        title="click on the red phone at the bottom of the Not Allowed page at Moe's!"
        ><b>Not Allowed!</b></span
      >
      page, to incorporate a bit of the source material and pay homage to the
      Internet exploration of my youth.

      As explained in our style and content guides, inaccuracies, typos, and
      graphic design hideousness are intended to be diegetic. My fork of the

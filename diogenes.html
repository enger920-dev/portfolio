    <p>
      Diogenes the Cynic (c. 413/403 – c. 324/321 BC), <br />also known as
      Diogenes of Sinope, was an ancient Greek <br />philosopher and one of the
      founders of Cynicism. Renowned <br />for his ascetic lifestyle, biting
      wit, and radical critiques of <br />social conventions, he became a
      legendary figure whose life <br />and teachings have been recounted, often
      through anecdote, <br />in both antiquity and later cultural
      traditions.<br />
